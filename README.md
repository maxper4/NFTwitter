# NFTwitter 

This is a twitter clone but with NFTs. You can post a tweet, reply to another one, like and send tips. All tweets are NFTs and can then be traded on OpenSea for example. The smart-contract is live on the Goerli Testnet: ```0x182dD618C81e7b1DaFC83f91857eD6c1D35dC1B6``` and the frontend is deployed on replit: https://nftwitter-front.maxper4.repl.co/.

Units tests are available in the `test` folder:
